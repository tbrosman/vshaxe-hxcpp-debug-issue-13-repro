# This is a manually-created stub hxml.

# HACK: This path is Windows-specific, doesn't handle custom extension directories, and includes the vshaxe.hxcpp-debugger version.
# - The path is Windows-specific because the ~ syntax is not supported in lix for Windows.
# - The version is included because hxcpp-debug-server is not hosted on the haxelib server, but a local haxelib installed by the
#   extension (and probably version-locked to the extension).
